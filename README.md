# E-Portfolio Content Management System
## Description
For everyone's information, this is my Final Year Project (FYP) titled E-Portfolio Content Management System. Basically, this E-Portfolio Content Management System is a web application that allows users/lecturers to record the content of teaching portfolios digitally. It is a repository place where users/lecturer can store their teaching and learning in the e-portfolio system.

E-portfolios is a popular information system as a tool to develop learning and teaching. It used to show a person's abilities and competencies and are generally defined as a collection of facts and evidence that shows a person's learning and teaching journey over time. Portfolios can be used to define a more general concept that encompasses a person's lifelong learning, or they can be restricted to a specific discipline.
## What is Content Management System?
A content management system (CMS) is a software application that enables users to create, edit, collaborate on, publish, and store digital content. Basically, a CMS provides a graphical user interface with tools to create, edit and publish web content without the need to write code from scratch.
